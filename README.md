# Digital Jalebi-React Assignment

This is an assignment given by Digital Jalebi for the intership process of an entry level React developer job.<br>
In this we have to fetch data using an API and display it in a tabular form and then apply searching on it.

<br>

# API Reference

#### Get all items

```http
  https://dummyjson.com/users
```


#### Search for an item

```http
  https://dummyjson.com/users/search?q=<query>
```

#### Get one item

```http
  https://dummyjson.com/users/{id}
```

# Run Locally
{using VSCode terminal for the installation process  is prefered}

First create a folder and initialize an empty Git repo in it(make sure you have git in your system)

```bash
  git init
```
    
Clone the project using: 

```bash
  git pull https://github.com/nandiniiiiiiii/Digital-Jalebi.git
```
    
Install vite

```bash
  npm i vite
```
    
Install npm 

```bash
  git pull https://github.com/nandiniiiiiiii/Digital-Jalebi.git
```

If any dependency error kindly install the following:

```bash
